<details><summary><h3>What happend to Minesraft2?</h3></summary>

Minesraft2 was sent a cease and desist from Blooket, and 05konz offered to take over since he wouldn't be able to.
</details>

<details><summary><h3>How do I do this on mobile?</h3></summary>

These scripts aren't made for mobile, so we don't really know how to get them to work on it.
</details>

<details><summary><h3>What's the Mobile GUI?</h3></summary>

The mobile GUI is the first GUI Minesraft2 ever made. Some people said it worked on mobile and it's a lot neater for mobile use apparently so we just called it that.
